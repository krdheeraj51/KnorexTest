# KnorexTest
 I have added two packages in application express and mongoose.So for installing these packages use command
 1. npm install express --save
 2. npm insatall mongoose --save
 After that execute command node index.js
 Note : this code contains little it doesn't add JSON array object but also it adds lable and string object.Due to lack of time 
 I can not be able to resolve it.

 Now, open your postMan and on body select x-www-form-unlencoded and enter http://localhost:3000/api/V1/test/create inside our  url then after select post verb and inside 
 key-value pair insert these 
 label:India
 values:IN
 
 After that submit.
